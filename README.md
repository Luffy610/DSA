## Introduction
This repository aims to provide clear and concise Python implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand these concepts or an experienced programmer seeking reference implementations, you'll find these examples helpful.

## Data Structures Implemented
Currently, the following data structure has been implemented:

- Linked List: Implementation includes all basic operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, searching, and more.
## Usage
To use the implementations, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

        git clone https://github.com/Luffy610/DSA.git
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

       cd Linked-List
3. Run the Python script for the data structure you're interested in. For example, to use the Linked List implementation:

       python single.py
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the data structure.
